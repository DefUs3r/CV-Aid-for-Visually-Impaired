### Project Title: 
360° Camera Scene Understanding for the Visually Impaired (VI)  

### Project Abstract 
The goal of this project is to aid VI people cross an intersection through the use of crowdsourcing and a 360° camera. The visual data acquired from this camera will be compared to a smartphone attached to a lanyard. Through the use of machine learning and computer vision algorithms, the collected data will be used to predict the correct crossing direction and determine the distance needed to cross the intersection.

The motivation for this project is to facilitate crossing an intersection for the VI safely. When crossing an intersection, veering outside the white lines can cause accidents and result in injuries/death. Currently, Professor Jeremy Cooperstock’s lab worked on a method which uses a conventional smartphone camera to detect the white lines on a crossing. The limited field-of-view tends to miss out on relevant information required to understand the surrounding environment. The field-of-view of a 360° camera can acquire this missing information to determine a safer route for the VI.

Our primary objective for this project is to provide feedback for VI people to successfully walk across an intersection using their smartphone. If we are to achieve this successfully, we would like to expand the project scope to alternate scenarios including traffic light state, obstacle detection and guidance for doorways and stairwells.
